  <p>
    XYZ NGO is an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality of education in India. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in the slums of India, XYZ NGO has grown in both scope and scale, with programs today reaching children and youth across the country.
    As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, XYZ NGO focuses on high-quality, low-cost and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Working  directly with children and youth as well as through large-scale collaborations with government systems, XYZ NGO programs reach millions of lives every year. XYZ NGO's Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach has demonstrated proven impact on children's learning outcomes and is now being adapted to contexts outside India.
